I would like to work as a freelance Web Designer Developer, Graphic Designer, Photographer, Video Production Editing in my own home business. I have learn new things with each project. I’m moving towards having my own designs and selling them. Whether it be t-shirt designs, my photography, or just continuing to do projects for my clients are always my first priority. I am positive I will always be in this line of work.

I’m a first year student in Creative Digital Media. From a young age, I had a strong interest
in art, drawing and sketching. So I knew that doing something creative was the best
approach for me. I graduated from the St Joseph for Deaf Boys in 2013. I’ve attended
college for 2 years. I have a certificate in Graphic Design with distinction from a previous
course in 2015. Because of that course it made me interested in attending the ITB course to study Creative Digital Media. I’m still studying at the moment and I have gotten better at practice for the Web Development, Introduction to Digital Media, Design Process & Practice, Personal Development, Visual Creativity, Universal Design and Photography are fulfilling in every way. I would love to learn them more modules in regard to my interests. I have found that I am a creative person as well as energetic, adept of technology and proficient in the use of Adobe Creative Suite and iMovie All I really want to do. I’ve skilled at free-hand drawing and designs I like to push my boundaries and come up with new innovative ideas. I have an interest in sketching during my free time as this enhances my creativity. I have a strong eye for design and colour co-ordination I love working on challenging jobs in creative digital media that come my way.
